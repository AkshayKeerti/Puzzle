# Puzzle
The 8-puzzle consists of a 3 by 3 grid. On each grid square there is a title, except for one square that remains
empty. The 8 tiles are numbered from 1 to 8 respectively, so that each tile can be uniquely identified. A tile
next to the empty square can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous square empty in turn. The
objective of the 8-puzzle problem is to find a solution, a sequence of tile moves, which leads from any initial
grid configuration to a given goal grid configuration.

For this assignment you are asked to write a program in Java for solving the 8-puzzle problem by using an
appropriate state space search strategy, which can find an optimal solution in the sense that the number of
moves needed is minimum, and you should provide sufficient comments in your program code.
